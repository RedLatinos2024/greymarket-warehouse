> When Facebook launched, I don't know if anyone realized how disruptive it would become. I don't think anyone realized what kind of standard it would set for websites that followed in its footsteps.
> The entire human socialization process was almost immediately disrupted.
>
> You can see your ex wife all over the place. You can become artificially popular. You can manipulate people or pixels into giving you bigger numbers on a screen.
>
> The social rewards for manipulating, or incentivizing numbers on a screen became greater than the social rewards for actually interacting with humans in real life. It's been all downhill since that became normal.
>
> # The kicker
> The fundamental flaw of Web 2.0 is that there was never any verifiable way to prove who is human and who is not.
> There are no signed keys. You do not have access to centralized proprietary hardware. You can't see what is happening on the backend with centralized cloud services.
> How can you verifiably, mathematically, prove the difference between the human Elon Musk sending out a Tweet/X-Post or if it was a bot or AI spewing out nonsense?
> How can you verifiably prove that the first interactive response is not the same human, or another bot, or another AI generated blob of nonsense?
> You literally can't. That is where the disaster spawns.
